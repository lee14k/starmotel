With their rates being near the best in the UP, and their location a short hike away from a gorgeous view of lake Michigan, you really can't beat the Star. It's the only place we stay in the UP that isn't camping! "

I consider it my rental \"lodge room\" when I am in the UP. The owners have been very kind and friendly. Plus.........the tap water is good and cold! I look forward to pulling into the parking lot as soon as I cross the bridge."
